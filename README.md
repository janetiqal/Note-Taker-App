# Note-Taker-App
Homework Assignment 11, build a Note Taker App with a funcitonal front & back end.
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to use an Express.js back end and to create an application where users can keep track of tasks by being able to create notes, save them, and delete them. 
## User Story
```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```
## Description
This application has a front end and a function back-end using Express.js. My task was to connect the front end to the back end to make a functional application where users can create, save, and delete notes. I used the fs system to write the notes to and used it to retrieve the notes from. I created routes that connected the html pages and the api/notes page. I also created a post method and delete method, so users were able to add new notes and delete previously written notes. 
## Links to Deployed App
The app is deployed by [Heroku](https://note-taker-appji.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
Run npm install after opening the server.js file in the terminal. Write a note, click the save icon. Click the delete/trash icon to delete a note. 
## Credits
